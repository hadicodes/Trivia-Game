# TriviaGame

### Update (April 13, 2017) this is an earlier project. If I were to make changes to this repo, I would allow the user to see their correct and incorrect responses at the end of the quiz.


Welcome to Health Trivia

Rules of the Game:

Click on the start button to begin. You have 25 seconds to answer all questions. Click the done button when you are finished to see your results.

This trivia game was designed to have multiple choice options.
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly. The game was made using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.
